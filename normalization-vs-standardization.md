# normalization-vs-standardization


## Good video

Are below points true?

- scaling (standardization or normalization) is required when our algorithms use gradient calculation like neural networks and regression???

- scaling is not required for distance based and tree based algorithms??
	- k-means clustering
	- support vector machines
	- decision trees

This one does not seem very true

when to choose?
for neural networks standardization since NN does not assume data distribution???

when outliers standardization is preferred
